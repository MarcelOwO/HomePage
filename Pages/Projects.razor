                    Just a small disclaimer that this part of the website is still work in progress and I usually update this very sparely. Probably will add a overlay with a proper explanation for each project in the future.
                    I also only list project that I have worked on in my free time. Projects that I would have done because of university are not listed here, as most are mostly for learning and have no outside use,
                    for example is a hangman game made in mips assembly, a compile for a simple language in java, various c,c++ and java projects for learning the language, some smaller unity projects and implementing some network protocols in c being the most notable ones.

                         A small group project during my apprenticeship.
                         The project goal was to build a working led matrix. I was mainly responsible for the code running the matrix and setting up the electronics that was controlling everything.
                         The matrix itself was made out of a neo-pixel led strip that we cut up and glued on wooden board, that was made by another teammate.
                         The matrix was controlled by an arduino mega, a bit overkill but we had on laying around.
                         The code that was running the matrix was rather simple. As i wasn't too familiar with coding at the time. I sourced most code from the web.
                         The main feature that I implemented were control flow and the control logic. The displayed images and games were sourced from the web.

                        I am currently hosting 3 websites that are built with the same tech stack, namely .net blazor.
                        Also also use the mudblazor library for the frontend.
                        The applications were originally hosted on my private proxmox server but out of laziness I moved them to azure, also I was getting some weird network problems since I do not have enough bandwidth.
                        The websites are my homepage, a page to advertise my avatar comissions and another website that is supposed be a planned for my friend group that would allow them to make it easier to go to conventions.
                        Though the last one is still in development.

                            I was inspired by a friend who was hosting a complete proxmox server at home to also host something similar.
                             So I reused on of my older laptops that I got from my old workplace to use it as a proxmox server.
                             The server was mainly used to host a couple small services and to play around with networking.
                             I had a container running that was hosting nginx so that I could host some websites.
                             I had a container for my homepage, for pi-hole, next-cloud and a couple other services.
                             The server is currently not in use as I moved some of my services to azure and am also not in need of the other ones.

                     The application was built to pretty much annoy my non so tech savvy friends.
                     The app allows me to select a file on my desktop and then enter a number, which would correspond to the number of times the file would be zipped.
                     It would then allow me to save the file where I want.

                             It is a kit for building a small musical tesla coil.
                             Annoying while ordering it was cought by customs and I needed to pay a fee to get it.
                             At least it was categorized as a instrument so I had to pay less.
                             Anyway the kit was a simple solid state tesla coil with a external controller that would send light signal to the coil to play music.
                             Apart from having some issues on applying enough varnish to the coil and the disgusting smell of ozone while using it, it was a fun project.

                          The bot would then join the voice channel that was programmed into.
                          And in the UI you could then select which one of those song you want to play.

                    Anyway I have setup a dual boot environment on my laptop with windows 11 and arch linux.
                    I am currently using kde as the desktop environment and before that I was using hyprland.

                            I joined a game jam in 2024 to see what I could create in about 4 days of development.
                            So I joined the GMTK game jam. The theme was 'built to scale'.
                            Anyway I decided to make a horror game, since I find those the most interesting. 
                            I created the game using unity hdrp and blender for the models.
                            The game was about a person that was trapped in a basement and the goal was to escape.
                            I haven't really finished the game and therefor didn't submit.
                            It was still a fun experience, enough though I made my life harder with the choice of game.
                            The game was also using analog horror as the main theme. 
                            The final version allowed you to wander around the small basement and you where able to interact and  pickup some items. Like a flashlight, a key and a computer.
                            The latter was used a guide in the game.

                            The project was rather simple, I had a simple methode that created the mesh data for each voxel.
                            The Data would then be sent to be split into chunks which would then be sent to a function to create the mesh for each chunk.
                            It would also reuse the textures from minecraft to texture the voxels.

                            I might update the project in the future to improve the runtime performance by disabling rendering faces that are facing the other way, 
                            add greedy meshing to the generating methods, some procedural generation and other things if I am bored enough.

                                                The issues is that windows when encountering with new sound devices, would sometimes change the default audio device to the new one.
                                                This service would run in the background and use the windows api to check if the default audio device has changed and if it has it would change it back.
